# Node.js Express Tutorial

## Overview

An educational Node.js application demonstrating the Express.js web framework with multiple HTTP endpoints. This tutorial illustrates fundamental concepts of routing, request handling, and response generation using industry-standard tools.

## Features

- Express.js framework integration
- Two HTTP GET endpoints
- Plain text responses
- Environment-configurable port
- Simple, beginner-friendly code structure

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v10.x or later (v20.x recommended)
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js

Check your versions:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

This will download Express.js and its dependencies into the `node_modules/` directory.

## Running the Server

Start the server using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
Server listening on port 3000
```

The server is now running and ready to accept requests.

## Available Endpoints

### GET /hello

Returns a simple greeting message.

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/hello
```

**Response:**
```
Hello world
```

**Status Code:** 200 OK  
**Content-Type:** text/plain

### GET /evening

Returns an evening greeting message.

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/evening
```

**Response:**
```
Good evening
```

**Status Code:** 200 OK  
**Content-Type:** text/plain

## Testing in Browser

You can also test the endpoints by opening these URLs in your web browser:

- http://localhost:3000/hello
- http://localhost:3000/evening

## Stopping the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

## Project Structure

├── .gitignore        # Git exclusion patterns
└── node_modules/     # Dependencies (generated by npm install)
```

## Configuration

The server port can be configured using the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

Default port: 3000

## Learning Objectives

This tutorial demonstrates:

- Setting up a Node.js project with npm
- Installing and using Express.js framework
- Defining multiple HTTP routes
- Handling GET requests
- Sending plain text responses
- Configuring application settings

## Next Steps

To expand your learning:

- Add more endpoints with different paths
- Implement POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- Add JSON response handling
- Integrate middleware (body-parser, morgan)
- Implement error handling
- Add route parameters and query strings
